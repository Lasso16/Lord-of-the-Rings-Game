# Lord-of-the-Rings-Game
This is a simple battle game. You have to create the heroes army and the beasts army. When you press the 'FIGHT' button, the battle is written in a new window.

There are two columns: one for the heroes army and the other one for the beasts army. It shows a list view of all available characters. You can add a new character, join them to your team or delete them.
In the second table view, you can reorganize your team or take out any character.

When both teams are ready, press 'fight' button to read the course of the battle. The last line shows which team is the winner.

It's my final project of my java studies. I'm open to read your recommendations and tips to improve this project and the next ones.
